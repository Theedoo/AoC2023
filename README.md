# AoC2023
Advent of Code 2023 answers created in python while learning it.

## Day 1
Not knowing that other people would be seeing this code, I decided to use barely-readable variable names
First day learning python, decided to try learning regex as it seemed easiest for this case not knowing any other ways to do this.
I started this much later as this is about when I heard about it.
- Part 1 finished in 19:38:22, placed #137855
- Part 2 finished in 21:37:24, placed #101053
- Part 2 took 2 hours from the completion of Part 1

## Day 2
Part 1 isn't included because I thought "oh, you could just do this by hand and do it really quickly!" and, I wasn't wrong.
- Part 1 finished in 21:40, and placed #4875

## Day 6
Nothing to add, pretty straightforward.
- Part 1 finished in 01:12:26, placed #13576
- Part 2 finished in 01:13:49, placed #12625
- Part 2 took 1 minute and 23 seconds as it was more or less the same program, just with larger numbers to calculate
